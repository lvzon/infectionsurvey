Crowdsourced respiratory infection data, based on self-reported symptoms

This repository will report the results of the following survey: https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/crowdsourcedrespinfectiondata

With this survey, you can self-report symptoms of respiratory infections such as COVID-19, Influenza and common cold. This survey is an effort to create a crowdsourced, open data set of both mild and severe respiratory infections, which could be used to inform research and policy with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic. Please note that this is not a coordinated data collection effort, this survey was set up by a single non-affiliated biologist, based only on a personal assessment of which information would be useful in creating a computer simulation of respiratory virus infections. Information collected through this survey will be made anonymous, and the data set will be published daily in this github repository (https://github.com/lvzon/infectionsurvey), when sufficient data is available.
Please note that the quality and usefulness of this data set depends on the accuracy and honesty of the people who enter data.
